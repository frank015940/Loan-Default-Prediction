# Loan-Default-Prediction.

# Introduction

Financial sector has emerged as the benchmark in leveraging the potential of data analtytics and machine learning to not only improve operations but to also proactively minimise the risks.

Our primary goal is to use data science tool as predictive modelling to build a strong framework capable of predicting loan outcomes.Our technique has the potential to help financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions.

SuperLender uses data driven a data-driven  approach to assess the credit risk of its customers and determine  the two fundermental drivers of repayment; `willingness` and `ability`.We will explore how SuperLender uses machine learning models to predict loan outcomes and evaluate their performance.


# Business Understanding

Defaulting borrowers cause significant financial losses, impacting profit margins and liquidity ultimately affecting long-term business sustainability. Moreover, loan defaults can tarnish a company's reputation, erode investor confidence, and hinder future borrowing opportunities. 

Super Lender a local digital lending company seeks to provide effective credit risk model which determines borrower’s chances of repaying a loan. In this project we seek to develop a credit risk model employing machine learning techniques. The model assesses historical data to predict potential defaults, enabling proactive risk management. Also the model informs credit manager and the institution’s employees on borrower important details to enable data driven decisions not only to deny or advance a loan  but targeted strategies, including personalized loan terms.

# Problem Statement

A defaulted loan is an expense to the business. There is a need for financial institutions to enhance their risk assessment strategies and only lend responsibly.  As such predicting customer loan defaults is central to minimizing financial risks and ensuring sustainable lending practices. Chances of customer paying their loan are influenced by demographics and past financial details. The challenge is for financial institutions to distinguish customers who can pay loans and only lend to them.

## Main Objective

To develop a model which predicts customer loan repayment chances.

## Specific Objective

* Determine which demographic factors affects customer loan repayment chances.
*	Determine which past financial details and behavior affects customer loan repayment chances
*	To develop a UI which informs credit manager on customer’s loan repayment details.
